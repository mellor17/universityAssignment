### N-Body Simulator
The N-body problem is a classical mechanics problem where you are attempting to simulate N >= 3 and predict their motions using quasi-stable variables such as the gravitational constant. 

To greater understand the problem, we should first look at Newton's sec

The reason I say attempting is because N >= 3 has no complete analytical soultion like the Two-body problem 


The parameters we need the time step for each loop, so how far in the future each 

$F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{|r^2|}r$ <-- This only works for two bodies

$F=$ force between two bodies what we are calculating
$G=$ gravitional constant
${m_n}=$ masses of n bodies
$|{r_2}|$ = 

${m_i \frac{d²r_i}{dt²} = Σ_{j≠i} G m_i m_j (r_j − r_i) / |r_j − r_i|³ }$

$m_i$ = The mass of object i
t = time
$r_i$ = this is a bold because it is a vector

${G \approx 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N}(\text{m/kg})^2}$ - Gravitational Constant 

Σ - sigma - summation symbol

The force that one body feels from another is equal to a the product between gravitional constant, both masses, inverse square of the distance between and the unit vector pointing from the first body towards the source.

Vectors have force and direction, scalars only have force.

Vector = 2 values
Scalar = 1
